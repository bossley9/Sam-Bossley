        <p>Morrill Tower Defense is a virtual reality bow and arrow game created using Unreal Engine 4.17.2. The purpose of creating this game was to experiment with virtual reality using the engine. Most of the game is built using Unreal's Blueprints, with a small amount done using C++.</p>
        <p>A lot of the game is built around the player's interaction with the world. The main character can interact with the world by pressing buttons, grabbing/dropping weapons, and teleporting to different locations. The bow is able to spawn arrows that can be shot in any direction, using motion controller vibration and velocity calculation.</p>
        <p>The goal of the game is to defeat each successive wave of enemy robots of different types. The enemy character models are modelled from Blender and controlled using an AI created in Blueprints.</p>
        <p>The final output game's materials mostly use static lighting to not detract from the game performance.</p>
