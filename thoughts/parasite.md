8.8/10
First of all, fantastic job to everyone who made this movie. I'm not even sure how I'll start describing this movie so I'll start with the start and work my way through the movie.

As always, if you haven't seen the movie, please don't read ahead. It's best watched with an open mind.

I really enjoyed the opening exposition. The family is portrayed as a casual family living life. They are all very close and really know each other. The asian household is demonstrated through their behaviour when the head of the household, Kim, commands his family to leave the windows open to kill the stink bugs. This sets up the parasitic dynamic later on in the story.

Character development was fantastic. The main character, Kevin, changes completely as the story progresses. He starts serving for the Park household unsure but confident in his abilities - so much, in fact, that he has the confidence to kiss Da-Hye. Then his attitude changes once the Park family returns from their trip early. We can tell from his expressions walking back in the rain that he does not want to go home, nor to the Park house. He is confronted by Da-Hye and dismisses her. Instead, he feels fake. He disregards her and heads to the basement. After the incident takes place, he switches to a determined goal to save his father from the chains of the house.

Kim has the most interesting attitude throughout the story. At the start, he seems eager to accept his son's "plan" to infiltrate the family, and rehearses with vigor. As Moon-Gwang is introduced, it is evident his attitude changes as he realizes he must do everything in his power to protect his family. He even says something along the lines of "thank god" as soon as he realizes she has been hurt possibly beyond healing. He continues to shut them in calmly. At this point in the story, he has accepted his fate. His turning point occurs the night before the incident, in the shelter, when Kevin asks him what his plan was. He responds with "Plan? There is no plan. Every time you plan, you lose. Did we plan to stay the night in this shelter? I don't have a plan. I could fucking kill a general if I wanted to" (I'm paraphrasing because I can't find the movie online to find the exact quote), and this last comment is a direct foreshadow to what lies ahead. At this point in the film I assumed he would kill Geun-sae, but as it turns out, the unexpected happens. Then, right before the incident, when Mr. Park is talking  to him behind the bush about their party plan, we can see in his eyes that he knows what will happen if he doesn't intervene. Mr. Park even senses this, and reminds him of the double pay. At the end, I'm not sure whether Kim has overcome his trauma, but he clearly loves his family so much that he did this to save all of their reputations and condemn himself.

Overall, I would describe this movie as stressful. The whole movie is built around the premise that they are all living a lie, and as the movie progresses, the stakes increase and the anticipation for an event to take place rises through the roof. It is unsettling, though in a different way. At the time of the incident, I actually felt relieved because at that point, the situation was beyond repair. I think this is a direct comparison to Kim's attitude at that point as the events take place.

Sorry, I'm jumping around but I'd like to touch on themes while the movie is still fresh in my mind.
Clearly, the movie showcases the struggles of class extremes, as well as lower class citizens fighting to stay on top. The movie demonstrates that masks cannot hide everything. The Park family struggles so much to hide their shortcomings such as Da-Song and Da-Hye's poor schooling skills, and Mr. Parks' "incompetent" driver and housekeeper. On top of that, The entire family tries to hold things together. The movie is built around lying, stealing, and struggle to stay on top, "relevant", or "afloat".

The movie's characters consistently mention the architecture of the physical house, speaking of its designer. All characters are constantly trying to understand the purpose of the house, and what the architect had in mind. The house is symbolism to the plan, where each turn of events leads to more unexpected events and constant downward spirals of confusion and frantic flailing.
During the camping trip as the main family eats, Kevin alludes to Ki-Jeong's death by saying that she fits living in the house, as if condemning her to the house.

The rock is also a large part of the story. Kevin attributes bad wealth to the rock, and thinks that by bringing it down to the basement, he will rid himself of his bad fortune. Instead, he is almost killed and causes the incident to take place. One could say that leaving the rock in the basement unleashed all the evil loose to the house.

Retrospectively looking back on the movie, I see that the art of the cover shows Kim in front of all other characters. This is because while Kevin narrates the story, Kim is the true main character of the story, based on his dynamic character development throughout the movie.

I now understand the reason for the title "Parasite". This movie is a masterpiece. I think the framing of the story was done beautifully and would recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of my personal opinions of the movie. These thoughts are unorganized and I would like to watch it again to fully digest the story, themes and dialogues present in the story.
