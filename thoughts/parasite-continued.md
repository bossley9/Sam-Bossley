I know I've already told everyone how much I absolutely adore this movie and why I think it's one of the best movies of all time, and I've already written a vague synopsis and analysis of the movie. But due to the limited nature of the movie, there's so much of the movie that I missed or failed to mention. Now that the movie is widely available online and via DVD or Blu-Ray (and in high definition), I want to better expand upon my favorite details of why this is a timeless masterpiece of a movie.

[If you didn't read my initial review, you can read it here](/thoughts/parasite). It's a little broken with unfinished thoughts, but I think it provides a little context.

As always, if you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend doing so before continuing, because once the illusion of the movie is shattered, it's hard to rewatch it with the same mindset. [Here is the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xH0HfJHsaY).

I initially planned on talking about lighting and filmography, but I don't want to steal the fire of other people who have analyzed some of the deeper details of these aspects. [Thomas Flight does a great job explaining the cinematography of the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF6O93noHRc), and [Accented Cinema expands more upon the fine-tuned details of filmography and lighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezwSfT7sXO0). Of course, I want to say that the [rain sequence pan from the trailer](https://youtu.be/hMZXftEFxvk?t=134) is one of the coolest scenes in the movie, and it's initially what sparked my interest in watching the movie.

[The first reveal of the basement is amazing with its camera work](https://youtu.be/hY1XW9rU3hk?t=191). I love how the camera slightly lags behind Chung Sook as she follows Moon Gwang into the depths of the basement, because the camera is acting as if you are following Moon Gwang. The camera lags slightly behind and slowly turns with each corner, adding suspense and fear to the entire sequence, because a first-time viewer has no idea what to expect with each motion.

My favorite scene in the entire movie is the [gym scene, in which Kevin asks his father about his original plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUJgT2piBRg). In my eyes, this scene is the sub-climax of the movie for Mr. Kim. Before this moment, Mr. Kim (and his family) has always been insistent on following "a plan", or sticking to "the plan" (the word "plan" is mentioned 11 times before this interaction, and much of Mr. Kim's dialogue is centered around planning - in fact, if you rewatch the movie, you'll notice that every member of the family talks about "the plan", or what "they plan to do"). Mr. Kim is a very orderly, focused individual. He acts upon circumstances and measures the outcomes. He follows orders or carries out actions because he knows the exact consequences of such an action. But here, in the gymnasium, he has come to the harsh reality that plans never work out. No one can predict the future, and no one can control the outcomes of an action. This is the objectively most impactful scene in the entire movie because this is Mr. Kim's turning point. Up until this point he has believed that his plans will always prevail, and things always work according to the plan. But this is not the case. He begins to understand that when a plan derails, he has to take drastic measures to adjust to the outcomes - in this case, the basement situation. He realizes that he will have to take drastic, maybe even illegal, measures to ensure the safety of his family and himself. He even alludes to [his idea to kill Mr. Park later in his monologue](https://youtu.be/yUJgT2piBRg?t=84), which confirms that he has been contemplating the act before it even took place. But this turning point for Mr. Kim's rationale changes the entire ending of the story, the ending we see in the movie.

I especially love the choice of music behind his monologue. In the official soundtrack, [the song is titled "The Frontal Lobe of Ki Taek"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jk9Fj5Fcr8). The frontal lobe of the brain primarily controls future planning, self management, and most importantly, judgment. The soundtrack indicates that at this moment, Ki Taek (Mr. Kim) is planning to kill Mr. Park, and judging, or weighing, the consequences. He had already planned to kill Mr. Park from the moment he escaped the house, and the [same song theme plays just as he hears Mr. Park and Mrs. Park gag at his "subway smell" crossing the line](https://youtu.be/Y1OgTE3ijSQ?t=120). But what is debatably most interesting about this scene is that he loses all sense of morality in this moment. He is no longer worried about murder, betrayal, or crime. He understands in this moment that he must do whatever it takes to prolong his and his family's survival. [He even mentions that it doesn't matter if you betray your own country](https://youtu.be/yUJgT2piBRg?t=83), arguably one of the greatest crimes a person can commit.

It's important to note that [in this specific moment of realization and expression, Mr. Kim covers his eyes with his arm](https://youtu.be/yUJgT2piBRg?t=65). This is identical to the eye-covering as shown on the movie cover, and I don't think it's a coincidence Bong Joon Ho chose to have Mr. Kim make this powerful motion. Specifically in Korea and in other various countries, bars are usually displayed over a person's eyes to anonymize a criminal suspect. Similarly, covering your eyes hides your intentions and adds ambiguity to your words. I believe that at this moment, Mr. Kim becomes a criminal and loses a part of his humanity to protect his lineage.

To me, this is the sub-climax of the movie because it shows the complete shift of the character of Mr. Kim, initially dedicated to methodic and principled actions, which turn into a loss of humanity to survive. Rewatching this movie with the knowledge of the movie's denoument, it gives me chills to watch Mr. Kim cover his eyes while the camera slowly zooms. This subtle two-minute scene encompasses the turning point in Mr. Kim's downward spiral which inevitably and permanently contributes to the climax of the overall story.

[Another one of my favorite sequences is the rain sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMZXftEFxvk). The shots are all taken very far away from the family, so emphasize how small or weak they feel. As the family descends into their home, the movie purposely takes long, dragged out, and emphasized shots to show how far away their home is from the Park's home, emphasizing the differences between the two lifestyles. And yet, it shows the connection between the two basement families present in each home, and it depicts the actions of each household affecting each other. [A clear example of this is found here](https://youtu.be/hMZXftEFxvk?t=232), where Moon Gwang throwing up in the toilet immediately cuts to Ki Jung dealing with the backlogged sewage of the toilet. It cuts as if Moon Gwang throwing up in the toilet is actually the source of the sewage flowing out of the toilet. It's metaphorical, as the actions of Mr. Kim and his family taken against Moon Gwang and Geun Se have lasting consequences on the family's future. [Again, this is reemphasized, with Geun Se hitting the light button](https://youtu.be/hMZXftEFxvk?t=314) manifesting as the flickering light in the semi-basement home, and you can notice that the blinking pattern is very similar to the pattern made by Geun Se.

And, of course, the subtle details are what really add to the immersion of the story and bring the characters to life. When Mr. Kim eats bread at the very start of the movie, it's moldy, but he eats it anyways, demonstrating the low financial status of the family. When Mr. Kim drags his body out from under the table, the camera cuts to a shot of only his feet, similar to a body being dragged. [When they run in the rain through a tunnel, a car is in the background pressing on the brakes](https://youtu.be/hMZXftEFxvk?t=23). They could have easily blocked the tunnel toÂ  prevent cars from being in the shot, but I think they purposely placed it to signify caution, or stopping, as if the family has gone too far. Shortly after, [they stop for a brief moment in a yellow light, signifying safety and warmth](https://youtu.be/hMZXftEFxvk?t=41). The next morning, as Mrs. Park chooses what to wear for the day, it immediately cuts to the family choosing clothes from piles of spare clothes in the gym. Mr. Park's wife jokes on the phone with her friends about "getting drunk in the daylight", unintentionally mocking the previous day with the family.

There's so much to this movie that I have yet to look into and break down, and it's such a unique and driving story. I could go on forever listing details that make this movie stand out from the rest. These are only a few reasons as to why I consider this movie to be one of the greatest movies of all time.
