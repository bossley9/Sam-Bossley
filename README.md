History of my main website code

This is a working history of all my main websites I've displayed on my domain, http://sam.bossley.us. It's continually a work in progress and I'm always learning new things about HTML, CSS, and W3C standards along the way.

Over the past few years I've been using less and less javascript for animations/events in order to reduce the amount of script files. I've also put effort into using fewer external files, such as fonts or icon fonts (sometimes I have to ask myself, "Is this really necessary? Does it contribute to the overall purpose of the page?").

I've additionally gotten better at compressing media (pngs, jpegs, and videos). In earlier versions I would use high resolution opaque pngs without further thought; however, time and experience has made me convert to smaller, color-stripped jpegs.
