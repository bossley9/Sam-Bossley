History of my main website code.

This history ranges from the initial website creation date (approximately June of 2012) up to the present. Over the years, I've undergone a lot of learning in respective languages (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, etc) resulting in reformatting my website for a more positive user experience. Currently, I'm focusing more heavily on web optimization and page loading speeds, combining good design with fast loading.
