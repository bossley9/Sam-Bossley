This is a working history of my website throughout the years. It's continually a work in progress and I'm always learning new things about good web development practices along the way.

Over the past few years I've been using less and less javascript for animations/events in order to reduce the amount of script files. I've also put effort into using fewer external files, such as fonts or icon fonts (sometimes I have to ask myself, "Is this really necessary? Does it contribute to the overall purpose of the page?").

I've additionally gotten better at compressing media (pngs, jpegs, and videos). In earlier versions I would use high resolution opaque pngs without further thought; however, time and experience has made me convert to smaller, color-stripped jpegs.

My main focus is to remove bloat and present a fully functional website while maintaining as few scripts and unnecessary clutter as possible.
